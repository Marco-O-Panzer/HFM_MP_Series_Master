mechanical_cotton;Mechanical Cotton Production;x
mechanical_cotton_desc;Egypt under Muhammad Ali in the early 19th century had the fifth most productive cotton industry in the world, in terms of the number of spindles per capita. The industry was initially driven by machinery that relied on traditional energy sources, such as animal power, water wheels, and windmills, which were also the principal energy sources in Western Europe up until around 1870. It was under Muhammad Ali in the early 19th century that steam engines were introduced to the Egyptian cotton industry.;x

industrial_bronze_production;Industrial Bronze;x
industrial_bronze_production_desc;Bronze, or bronze-like alloys and mixtures, were used for coins over a longer period.

Bronze is still commonly used in ship propellers and submerged bearings.;x
industrial_boots_production;Mass Shoe Production;x
industrial_boots_production_desc;Until the 19th century, shoemaking was a traditional handicraft, but by the century's end, the process had been almost completely mechanized, with production occurring in large factories.

EVTDESC7777930;The California Gold Rush (1848–1855) was a gold rush that began on January 24, 1848, when gold was found by James W. Marshall at Sutter's Mill in Coloma, California. The news of gold brought approximately 300,000 people to California from the rest of the United States and abroad. The sudden influx of gold into the money supply reinvigorated the American economy, and the sudden population increase allowed California to go rapidly to statehood, in the Compromise of 1850. The Gold Rush had severe effects on Native Californians and accelerated the Native American population's decline from disease, starvation and the California genocide. The population of the state grew faster than any other state in the US at its peak.;x
